Natural Language Processing
NLP is a field in machine learning with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language.

Some of its main sub-tasks include:

Tokenization consists of breaking up a text into smaller parts called tokens (which can be sentences or words) to make text easier to handle.

Part of speech tagging (PoS tagging) labels tokens as verb, adverb, adjective, noun, etc. This helps infer the meaning of a word (for example, the word “book” means different things if used as a verb or a noun).

Lemmatization & stemming consist of reducing inflected words to their base form to make them easier to analyze.

Stop-word removal removes frequently occuring words that don’t add any semantic value, such as I, they, have, like, yours,
